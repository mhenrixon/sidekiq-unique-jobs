= pusher-client (Ruby)

{<img src="https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-websocket-ruby.png" />}[https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-websocket-ruby]

pusher-client is a ruby gem for consuming WebSockets from the Pusher[http://pusherapp.com] web service.

The connection to Pusher can optionally be maintained in its own thread (see Asynchronous Usage).

This gem no longer depends on em-http, and is compatible with jruby since 0.2.

When binding to a global event, note that you still must be subscribed to the channels the event
may be sent on. You can't just bind a global event without subscribing to any channels and call it a day.

== Installation
  gem install pusher-client

== Single-Threaded Usage
The application will pause at socket.connect and handle events from Pusher as they happen.

  require 'pusher-client'
  options = { secure: true }
  socket = PusherClient::Socket.new(YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY, options)

  # Subscribe to two channels
  socket.subscribe('channel1')
  socket.subscribe('channel2')

  # Subscribe to presence channel
  socket.subscribe('presence-channel3', USER_ID)

  # Subscribe to private channel
  socket.subscribe('private-channel4', USER_ID)

  # Subscribe to presence channel with custom data (user_id is mandatory)
  socket.subscribe('presence-channel5', :user_id => USER_ID, :user_name => 'john')

  # Bind to a global event (can occur on either channel1 or channel2)
  socket.bind('globalevent') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  # Bind to a channel event (can only occur on channel1)
  socket['channel1'].bind('channelevent') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  socket.connect

== Asynchronous Usage
The socket will remain open in the background as long as your main application thread is running,
and you can continue to subscribe/unsubscribe to channels and bind new events.

  require 'pusher-client'
  socket = PusherClient::Socket.new(YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY)
  socket.connect(true) # Connect asynchronously

  # Subscribe to two channels
  socket.subscribe('channel1')
  socket.subscribe('channel2')

  # Bind to a global event (can occur on either channel1 or channel2)
  socket.bind('globalevent') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  # Bind to a channel event (can only occur on channel1)
  socket['channel1'].bind('channelevent') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  loop do
    sleep(1) # Keep your main thread running
  end

For further documentation, read the source & test suite. Some features of the JavaScript client
are not yet implemented.

== Native extension
Pusher depends on the websocket[https://github.com/imanel/websocket-ruby] gem
which is a pure Ruby implementation of websockets.

However it can optionally use a native C or Java implementation for a 25% speed
increase by including the websocket-native[https://github.com/imanel/websocket-ruby-native]
gem in your Gemfile.

== Contributing to pusher-client

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
