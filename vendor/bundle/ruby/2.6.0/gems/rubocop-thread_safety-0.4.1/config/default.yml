# Without adding these to your rubocop config, these values will be the default.

ThreadSafety/ClassAndModuleAttributes:
  Description: 'Avoid mutating class and module attributes.'

ThreadSafety/InstanceVariableInClassMethod:
  Description: 'Avoid using instance variables in class methods.'
  Enabled: true

ThreadSafety/MutableClassInstanceVariable:

  EnforcedStyle: literals
  SupportedStyles:
    # literals: freeze literals assigned to constants
    # strict: freeze all constants
    # Strict mode is considered an experimental feature. It has not been updated
    # with an exhaustive list of all methods that will produce frozen objects so
    # there is a decent chance of getting some false positives. Luckily, there is
    # no harm in freezing an already frozen object.
