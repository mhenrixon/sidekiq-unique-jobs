# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

sidekiq-unique-jobs is a Sidekiq middleware gem that prevents duplicate jobs from being enqueued or executed. It provides sophisticated locking mechanisms using Redis to ensure job uniqueness based on configurable parameters.

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb

# Run specific test by line number
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb:42

# Run tests with specific appraisals (different Sidekiq versions)
bundle exec appraisal rspec
bundle exec appraisal sidekiq-6.0 rspec
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run rubocop linter
bundle exec rake rubocop

# Run reek (code smell detector)
bundle exec rake reek

bundle exec rake release
```

## Architecture

### Lock Types

The gem implements multiple lock strategies that control when and how uniqueness is enforced:

1. **Client-side locks** (prevent duplicate enqueuing):
   - `until_executing` - Lock from push until job starts executing
   - `until_executed` - Lock from push until job completes execution
   - `until_expired` - Lock from push until configured TTL expires
   - `until_and_while_executing` - Combination lock (both phases)

2. **Server-side locks** (prevent duplicate execution):
   - `while_executing` - Lock only during job execution
   - `while_executing_reject` - Same as above but rejects conflicts

Lock implementations inherit from `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Lock::BaseLock` (lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lock/base_lock.rb) and implement two key methods:
- `lock` - Attempt to acquire the lock
- `execute` - Execute the job with appropriate lock behavior

### Core Components

**Middleware Stack:**
- `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Middleware::Client` - Intercepts job enqueuing
- `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Middleware::Server` - Intercepts job execution
- These must be manually configured in Sidekiq initializer (not auto-loaded)

**Lock Management:**
- `Locksmith` (lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/locksmith.rb) - Central lock manager that interfaces with Redis
- `LockDigest` - Generates unique digest from job parameters (queue, class, args)
- `LockConfig` - Extracts and normalizes lock configuration from job options
- `Key` - Manages Redis key naming with configurable prefixes

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Strategies in `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/on_conflict/` handle lock conflicts:
  - `log` - Log the conflict
  - `raise` - Raise exception (for retry)
  - `reject` - Send to dead queue
  - `replace` - Delete existing job and retry
  - `reschedule` - Delay and retry
- Inherit from `SidekiqUniqueJobs::OnConflict::Strategy`

**Lua Scripts:**
- All Redis operations use Lua scripts in `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lua/`
- This ensures atomic operations and consistency
- Scripts are loaded and executed via `Script::Caller` mixin
- Template system with shared functions in `lua/shared/`

**Orphan Cleanup:**
- `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Orphans::Manager` - Coordinates reaper lifecycle
- `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Orphans::RubyReaper` - Ruby-based cleanup (default)
- `SidekiqUniqueJobs::Orphans::LuaReaper` - Lua-based cleanup (faster but locks Redis)
- Reapers run periodically to clean up stale locks from crashed processes

### Configuration System

Global configuration via `SidekiqUniqueJobs.configure` block:
- Uses `Concurrent::MutableStruct` for thread-safe config
- Defined in `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/config.rb`
- Supports custom locks and strategies via `add_lock` and `add_strategy`

Per-worker configuration via `sidekiq_options`:
- `lock` - Lock type (required)
- `on_conflict` - Conflict strategy (can differ for client/server)
- `lock_timeout` - How long to wait for lock acquisition
- `lock_ttl` - Lock expiration time
- `lock_args_method` - Custom method/proc to filter uniqueness args
- `unique_across_queues` - Ignore queue in digest calculation
- `unique_across_workers` - Ignore worker class in digest calculation

### Redis Integration

The gem uses `redis-client` (not `redis` gem) via Sidekiq's connection pool. Wrapper classes in `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/redis/` provide object-oriented interfaces:
- `Redis::String` - String operations
- `Redis::Hash` - Hash operations
- `Redis::Set` - Set operations
- `Redis::SortedSet` - Sorted set operations
- `Redis::List` - List operations

All inherit from `Redis::Entity` base class.

### Reflection System

The gem provides hooks for observability (metrics, logging) via `SidekiqUniqueJobs.reflect`:
- `locked` - Lock acquired successfully
- `lock_failed` - Could not acquire lock
- `unlocked` - Lock released
- `unlock_failed` - Lock release failed
- `timeout` - Lock acquisition timed out
- `execution_failed` - Job execution raised error
- Other reflection points defined in `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/reflections.rb`

## Testing Guidelines

- Integration tests in `spec/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lock/*_spec.rb` cover each lock type end-to-end
- Lua script tests in `spec/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lua/*_spec.rb` verify Redis operations
- Use `SidekiqUniqueJobs.use_config` to temporarily override config in tests
- Disable uniqueness in tests with `SidekiqUniqueJobs.config.enabled = false`
- Use `Sidekiq::Testing.disable!` and clear Redis when testing actual uniqueness behavior

## Important Patterns

**Lock Arguments Filtering:**
Workers can define `self.lock_args(args)` class method or use `lock_args_method` proc to customize which arguments determine uniqueness. This is critical for jobs with transient parameters.

**Digest Algorithm:**
Two digest algorithms available:
- `:legacy` (default) - Uses MD5, may have issues with FIPS-enabled Redis
- `:modern` - FIPS-compatible alternative

**Middleware Ordering:**
When using with other Sidekiq middleware gems (apartment-sidekiq, sidekiq-global_id, sidekiq-status), order matters. Generally, this gem's middleware should run last on the client side and last on the server side (see README for specific gem combinations).

**After Unlock Callbacks:**
Workers can define `after_unlock` instance or class method for cleanup after lock release. Note: `until_expired` locks never call this callback.

## File Structure

- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs.rb` - Main entry point, requires all dependencies
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lock/` - Lock type implementations
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/on_conflict/` - Conflict resolution strategies
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/lua/` - Lua scripts for atomic Redis operations
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/middleware/` - Sidekiq middleware implementations
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/orphans/` - Orphaned lock cleanup system
- `lib/sidekiq_unique_jobs/web/` - Sidekiq Web UI extension
- `spec/` - RSpec test suite organized by component
- `myapp/` - Example Rails application for testing and development

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Lock digest issues**: If uniqueness isn't working as expected, check what's included in the digest (queue, worker class, args). Use `lock_info: true` to debug.

2. **While executing locks**: These won't prevent enqueueing duplicates, only concurrent execution. Often misunderstood by users.

3. **Lock expiration**: `lock_ttl` expires from when lock is created, not from when job finishes. For daily jobs, use `until_expired` with 1.day TTL.

4. **Reaper configuration**: The Lua reaper is faster but can block Redis. Keep `reaper_count` low (≤1000) when using `:lua` reaper. Use `:ruby` reaper (default) for safety.

5. **Testing uniqueness**: Don't test the gem's uniqueness behavior in your app tests. Trust the gem's test suite. Disable uniqueness in your tests with `config.enabled = false`.

6. **Middleware not loaded**: Since v7, middleware must be manually added to Sidekiq configuration. Check initializer follows the README pattern.
