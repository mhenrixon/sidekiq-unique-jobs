# Review GitHub PR Comments: $ARGUMENTS

You are reviewing and responding to all unresolved review comments on a GitHub pull request. Apply technical rigour -- evaluate each comment against the actual codebase before accepting or rejecting it.

## Phase 0: Determine the PR Number

The user may provide a PR number as `$ARGUMENTS`. Parse it flexibly:

- `PR123`, `PR 123`, `pr123` -> PR 123
- `123` -> PR 123
- `#123` -> PR 123
- Empty/blank -> auto-detect from current branch

**If no PR number is provided**, detect it automatically:

```bash
gh pr list --author=@me --head="$(git branch --show-current)" --state=open --json number,title
```

If exactly one open PR exists for the current branch, use it. If none or multiple, ask the user.

Once you have the PR number, confirm it:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,state,url
```

---

## Phase 1: Fetch All Unresolved Review Comments

Retrieve all review comments and identify unresolved ones:

```bash
# Get all review comments (not resolved)
gh api "repos/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments" --paginate

# Get all review threads to check resolution status
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            path
            line
            comments(first: 20) {
              nodes {
                id
                databaseId
                body
                author { login }
                createdAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner=mhenrixon -f repo=sidekiq-unique-jobs -F pr=<PR_NUMBER>
```

For each unresolved thread, extract:
- Thread ID (for resolving)
- Comment body (the review feedback)
- File path and line number (if inline)
- Author (to understand context)

Filter to only **unresolved** threads. Skip bot comments (CodeRabbit, dependabot), resolved threads, and PR description comments.

If there are no unresolved review comments, report that and stop.

---

## Phase 2: Read and Categorise Each Comment

For each unresolved comment, read the full body and categorise it:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Valid fix needed | Implement the fix |
| Valid test gap | Add the missing test |
| Valid style/consistency issue | Fix it |
| Incorrect suggestion | Push back with technical reasoning |
| Suggestion conflicts with architecture | Push back, reference existing patterns |
| Over-engineering / YAGNI | Push back, explain why it's unnecessary |
| Unclear | Ask for clarification (do NOT implement) |

**Before categorising**, always:
1. Read the actual file and line being commented on
2. Check if the suggestion is technically correct for THIS codebase
3. Check if it would break existing functionality
4. Check if existing patterns/conventions contradict the suggestion
5. Check CLAUDE.md rules -- project conventions override reviewer preferences

---

## Phase 3: Implement Accepted Fixes

For all comments you've decided to accept:

1. **Make the code changes** -- edit the relevant files
2. **Run affected tests** to verify nothing breaks:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec <relevant_spec_files>
   ```
3. **Run validators**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rubocop <changed_files>
   ```
4. **Commit** all fixes together with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   fix: address PR review feedback

   - Description of fix 1
   - Description of fix 2
   EOF
   )"
   ```
5. **Push** to the remote branch:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

## Phase 4: Reply to Every Comment

For **each** unresolved thread, reply:

### For accepted fixes:

Reply with what was fixed and the commit SHA:

```bash
gh api "repos/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/pulls/<PR>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies" \
  --method POST \
  -f 'body=Fixed in <SHA>. <Brief description of what changed>.'
```

### For rejected suggestions:

Reply with technical reasoning:

```bash
gh api "repos/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/pulls/<PR>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies" \
  --method POST \
  -f 'body=<Technical explanation of why the suggestion was not implemented>'
```

### Resolving threads (via GraphQL):

After replying, resolve the thread:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }
' -f threadId=<THREAD_NODE_ID>
```

### For general PR comments (not inline review threads):

Reply directly:

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "<Response addressing each point>"
```

---

## Phase 5: Verify Completion

After processing all comments, verify no unresolved threads remain:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          totalCount
          nodes { isResolved }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner=mhenrixon -f repo=sidekiq-unique-jobs -F pr=<PR_NUMBER>
```

Report the final tally: how many comments were accepted/fixed, how many were pushed back on, and confirm all threads are resolved.

---

## Response Style

When replying to comments:

- **No performative agreement** -- never say "Great point!" or "You're absolutely right!"
- **No gratitude** -- never say "Thanks for catching that"
- **Be direct** -- state the fix or the reasoning, nothing more
- **Reference commits** -- always include the short SHA when a fix was made
- **Be specific** -- when pushing back, reference actual code, not abstract principles

When pushing back:

- Use technical reasoning grounded in the actual codebase
- Reference existing patterns if the suggestion contradicts them
- Reference CLAUDE.md rules when applicable
- Explain what would break or what edge case the reviewer missed
- If the suggestion is valid in principle but wrong for this context, say so

---

## Important Notes

- Always read the actual code before evaluating a comment -- reviewers sometimes misread diffs
- If a comment reveals a genuine bug you missed, fix it without defensiveness
- If multiple comments suggest the same change, implement it once and reference the fix in all replies
- Bot reviewers (CodeRabbit, etc.) sometimes suggest changes that conflict with project conventions -- verify against CLAUDE.md
- If a new round of review comments appears after your push (from re-review), report that to the user rather than entering an infinite loop

Now begin by determining the PR number from `$ARGUMENTS` or the current branch.
